# Darts-and-pi-value-experiment

## Expirement: 

Suppose we're unaware of the exact value of $\pi$ (which is approximately 3.1416), but we're familiar with Pythagoras' theorem and the formula for the area of a circle, which is the square of its radius multiplied by $\pi$. Consider a square with a side length of $2a$ units, giving it an area of $(2a)^2$. Inside this square, a circle with a radius of a fits perfectly. While the precise value of $\pi$ remains unknown, we understand the area of the circle can be calculated as $\pi r^2$. By analyzing the relationship between the circle's area and the square's area, we find that the ratio is $\pi a^2/(2a)^2$. This insight provides a method to estimate $\pi$: by throwing random darts at a board enclosed by the square and counting how many land inside the circle. The proportion of darts within the circle to the total thrown reflects the area ratio, offering an approximation of $\pi$ with a sufficient number of darts.
